            You walk her to your car and proceed to start driving towards the safe house. Along the way, you converse with Holly in order to better understand her situation. She informs you that she lives alone and was in desperate need of cash in order to keep food on the table as well as cover rent, which is why she took up work in a bar at the age of sixteen. This is the ending snippet of the conversation you had with Holly:
            <br>  <br> 
            Holly: Anyways, thanks for listening to my story and for getting me away from all of those men. I hate the extra attention when I am simply trying to make ends meet so I don't starve or get evicted.
            
        <br>
     <br>
            You: No problem. Just so you know, I lied to your boss. She believes that I am taking you for the same reason those men were swarming you. In truth, I am bringing you to a safe house, where you will no longer have to worry about such actions from men.
            <br> <br>
            She stutters out a thank you and starts to cry out of relief and joy. Once you arrive, you and a coworker of four years, Steph, lead Holly to the dining room for a nutritional meal. After she finishes her meal and you place her dishes in the sink, you show her to her new room.
