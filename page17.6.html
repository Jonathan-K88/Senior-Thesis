    You: Hi Jennifer. I was informed that you requested counseling this week. 
       <br>
       <br>
   Jennifer: Hi. Yes, that is correct. I wanted to talk about my past and  start on my path to heal from it.
       <br> 
       <br>
    You: That's very brave of you. I will be asking a few questions; however, please feel free to only say what you are comfortable with and know that I am here to support you as well as listen to you. I will not judge you. 
       <br>
       <br>
    Jennifer: Thank you. What would you like to ask?
            <br><br>
    You: Firstly, I remember you briefly mentioned the use of drugs. Would you please fill in the context? 
            
            <br><br>
    Jennifer: Yes, well growing up, we were not financially stable and my parents turned to drugs early on in order to alleviate stress. It came to the point where they weren't capable of taking care of me and I was taken into a state-run children's home. 
            
            <br><br>
    You:And how was the children's home? Were you treated well?
            
            <br><br>
    Jennifer: Sadly, no. The place was terrible and we were regularly beaten, but wardens used the excuse that we were misbehaving. What's worse is that while I was there and thought my suffering would not end anytime in the near future, my true nightmare was about to begin... I need a moment to collect myself.
            
            <br><br>
            
    You: I absolutely understand. I would like to take this time to remind you that you are both brave and strong. 
            
        <br><br>
            
    Jennifer wipes a few tears: Thank you. As I was saying, a man came to visit me often at the children's house and seemed to take an interest in me. He promised that once I can leave the place, that he would help me find a job and take care of me. <br> <br>I didn't believe him completely, but I never imagined that he would take advantage of me and use my body for his pleasure when no one was around. After the first time he used me, I was terrified of being near him or worse yet, leaving with him and I started taking drugs.... I am sorry, I am exhausted with recounting all of this. Can we schedule another counseling session? 
       <br>
       <br>
    You: There is no need to apologize. You're very strong to be willing and able to remember this part of your life and we can always schedule another counseling session. Thank you for trusting me with such a personal account. I would also like to take the time to remind you that you are a survivor and the road ahead of you can be different than what exists behind you.
