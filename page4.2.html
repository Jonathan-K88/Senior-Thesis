             Lynn: Hiya, how are you today? 
             <br> <br>
            You: I'm doing well. How has your day been? 
            <br> <br>
            Lynn: It's been wonderful. I have found some recipes online that have piqued my interest and I have been given the green light to attempt baking a few of them next week. All that being said, there is something I am curious about and was wondering if you would be willing to explain it to me while I walk to my room for my journal filled with recipes.
            <br> <br>
            You: Of course. I will try to explain it to the best of my knowledge. What's on your mind?
            <br> <br>
            As you and Lynn walk to her room she asks: Well, not to bring the mood down, but as you know, my parents and I struggled to make ends meet and I was offered a deal that we believed would relieve us financially, but it later turned out to be a scam for trafficking. I have a decent idea of what that term means, but I am curious if there are any accepted definitions for general human trafficking and human sex trafficking.
