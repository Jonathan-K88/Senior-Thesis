            You: The impact on global health? Hmm, let me check online so that I can get some facts.
            <br><br>
            You browse articles on the subject until you come across one by PLOS and another by Medium: Ahh, here we go. The first article I found gives a bit of information about the impact on heath in Southeast Asia, while the second gives a broader view to the subject.
        <br><br>
        Lynn: Oh, what does the first article say?
        <br><br>
        You: It reads as follows: Among trafficking survivors in Southeast Asia, nearly half (48%) reported physical or sexual abuse and 22% sustained severe injuries, including lost limbs, and reported symptoms indicative of depression and anxiety disorders.
        <br><br>
        Lynn gasps in horror: That's terrible. The more I think about it, the more it breaks my heart.   
       <br><br>
        You: I completely agree.
