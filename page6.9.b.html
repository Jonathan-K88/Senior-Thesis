    <br> <br>
            You: That's understandable. Is there anything else you would like me to read from this website, while I still have the tab open?
            <br> <br>
            Lynn: Sure, what else does the page talk about?
            <br><br>
            You scroll down a bit and respond: I found some statistics in bullet point form.
            <br> <br>
            Lynn: Ok, I am willing to learn some statistics pertaining to all of this.
            <br> <br>
            You: All right then. This page says that human trafficking makes an estimated $99 billion a year.
