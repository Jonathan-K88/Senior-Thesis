  You: Hi Belle. I was informed that you requested counseling today.
        <br>
        <br>
     Belle: Hi. Yes, I simply don't want to live in constant fear anymore.
        <br>
        <br>
    You:That's very brave of you. Please, feel free to only say what you are comfortable with and know that I am here to support you as well as listen to you. I will not judge you. 
        <br>
        <br>
   Belle: Thank you. What would you like to ask?
            
            <br><br>
            You: Firstly, I remember you briefly mentioning that you faced some negativity from former foster parents. Could you please  fill in the context?
            <br><br>
            
            Belle responded with a saddened expression: Well to begin, I did not have a great upbringing. My parents died when I was 8 and I was sent from foster parents to foster parents, with no hope of finding an actual home. When I was eleven, my foster parents took me to stay with a friend of theirs for a few days, while they had to attend businness meetings. However, that's where my nightmare began.
            <br><br>
            You: Is this when you faced the abandonment that you mentioned?
            
            <br><br>
            Belle: Yes, they never retuned from their "business meetings" and the owner of the house happened to be the madame of a local brothel. She told me after a week of stay that my foster parents needed money so they struck a deal with her. Unfortunately for me, this meant that she is missing quite a bit of money and demanded that I repay her for my foster parents. I was locked up in a room and was visited daily by men who didn't care if I consented or ended up bloody. In their eyes, as long as they paid, they can do as they please. I still can't understand how people can think like that.  
        <br>
        <br>
            You: Neither can I, Belle. You have done a wonderful job. Would you like to continue or resume this conversation on another counseling session?
            <br><br>
            Belle: If it's acceptable, could we resume this conversation next time?
            <br><br>
   You: Yes, no need to worry. You were very strong today. Thank you for entrusting me with these details of your past.
