            As you walk toward your office, you decide to fulfill another aspect of your job: counseling. It's no surprise that survivors want to move on from their past and focus on their future. With that being said, it's not so simple to heal from the scars that can serve as a reminder of the life they used to live. <br> <br>For today, you can have a counseling session with Jennifer or Sofia. As you wrack your brain, you remember that Jennifer's past involved the use of drugs, Sofia's past involved a struggling household, desperately trying to avoid living on the streets.<br> <br> Which survivor would you like to counsel today: <a class="Choices" href= "page4.6.html">Jennifer</a> or <a class="Choices" href= "page4.7.html">Sofia</a>?   </font>
