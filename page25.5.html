                You: Hi Gwen. I was informed that you requested counseling today.
        <br>
        <br>
    Gwen: Hi. Yes, I want to move on with my life instead of constantly be haunted.
        <br>
        <br>
  You: That's very brave of you. I will be asking a few questions; however, please feel free to only say what you are comfortable with and know that I am here to support you as well as listen to you. I will not judge you. 
        <br>
         <br>
   Gwen: Thank you. What would you like to ask?
            <br><br>
            You: Firstly, I remember you briefly mentioning that you were forced servitude for a rebel army. Could you please  fill in the context? Were you born into the army?  <br><br>
   Gwen: Well to start, I was not born into the army, but rather in a village. During the early part, my life was beautiful. My family got along well and we were financially stable. We spent many days playing games with each other. However, at the age of 12, forces of a rebel army invaded our village at night and rounded up all of us.
            
            <br><br>
            You: Were there any casualties?
            
            <br><br>
            Gwen: I'm unsure if there were any. I remember seeing some of the villagers restained, while others were beaten. The rest of us were forced to walk for days and with guns pointed at us at all time. After days of traveling with no idea where we are, elders from our village were allowed to leave, but the rest of us were stuck with the army.  *sighs*
            <br><br>
            You quickly reassure her that she is doing well and encourage her to take all the time she needs.
            
            <br><br> 
            After regaing her thoughts, she responds with great pain:
            
            I was quickly trained to kill others, whether it be by blade or by gun and two years after my abduction, I was forcibly married off to one of the commanders. I had no choice but to do as he asks and when he wasn't around I had to keep the other wives from running away. I feared if I made a mistake, the commander would kill me. This was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. Could we resume this conversation next time? 
        <br>
        <br>
   You: Don't worry. You're doing great and of course we can resume this conversation later. Also, the you who is sitting in front of me is looking to move forward instead of returning to the life from your past. That is something to be proud of.
