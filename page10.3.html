        After taking a moment to collect herself, Lynn requests that you tell her the information you found in the second article.
        <br><br>
        You: Ok. This article focuses on general mental and physical impact that trafficking can result in. Are you sure you want me to tell you this information?
        <br><br>
        Lynn hugs herself and nods her head yes.
        <br><br>
        You let out a breath and compose yourself as you begin to tell her what you found: Along with the despression and anxiety that the previous article mentioned, other mental and psychological impact includes panic disorder, substance abuse, suicidal tendancies, Stockholm Syndrome, and PTSD. Along with this, victims often experience emotional trauma due to separation from families, friends, and local communities.
        <br><br>
        Lynn starts to tear up and stutters out: And the pysical impact?
        <br><br>
        You glance over the physical impact segment of the article and begin telling her what you found: Some victims are manipulated with tactics such as food deprevation, physical force, and torture. Common injuries include broken bones, burns, scars, and broken teeth. It also states that in a study conducted by Harvard School of Public Health, they found that in underdeveloped countries, 56% of victims were HIV postive. Reading a bit further, I found that 73.4% survivors of sex slavery reported to have some form of STI/STDâ€™s.
        <br><br>
        Lynn siffles and wipes her tears as she tries to compose herself: Can we stop there for today? I don't know how much more of this I can take for today.
        <br><br>
        You: I understand and absolutely agree.
        <br><br>
        Lynn: Well, I think I am going to see if Jennifer and Gwen want to bake today. See you later.
        <br><br>
         You: See you later, Lynn.
        <br><br>
        You walk to your office for counseling. Today, your choices are either Belle or Sofia. You remember that Belle's backstory includes abandonment by foster parents, while Sofia's past involved a struggling household, desperately trying to avoid living on the streets.
        
        <br> <br> Which survivor will you counsel today:  <a class="Choices" href= "page10.4.html">Belle</a> or <a class="Choices" href="page10.5.html">Sofia</a></font>.
