            Lynn: Equality Now? What is that?
            <br><br>
            You: It is an international organization that fights to end sex tafficking among other social issues. Oh, here on their main page, it's stated that they also fight to end legal inequality, sexual violence and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM), and "child marriage".

            Lynn: Wow, they seem to be trying to make a very large impact on the world. 
            <br><br>
            You: Yes, it definitely seems that way. Now then, on their facts sheet page, "fraud, abuse of power or vulnerability, or giving payments or benefits to a person in control of the victim" are also listed as methods utilized by traffickers. [2]  
            <br> <br>
            Lynn's face turned even paler as more methods were read and stated: This is making my stomach churn quite a bit.
