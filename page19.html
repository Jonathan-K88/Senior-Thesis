           As you wake up, you decided to answer the informant's request today and inform your boss about this small operation. After you receive an approval, you drive over to the bar in question and as you walk in, you see several men surrounding a teenage girl and all of them are yelling about who will take her home for the night and it's becoming increasingly violent. You quickly walk to the front and call for the mamasan. You motion to the girl being overwhelmed and terrified of the men around her and ask her how much it would cost to take her to your hotel room. You negotiate a price you can both agree on and the mamasan called the frightened girl over.
            <br> <br>  
            Mamasan: Holly, this client has paid a great amount for your services tonight. Be a good girl and go with him.
            <br /> <br />
            Holly: Yes, Madam. 
            <br /> <br>
