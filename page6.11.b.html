    <br> <br>
            
            You: According to this, the minimum number of trafficked individuals is 20.9 million adults and children. 
            <br> <br>
            Lynn starts to shed a few tears and mumbles: What statistics do you see specifically about sex trafficking?
            <br><br>
            You quickly hug her as you answer: Approximately 54% of victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation and about 2 million children are exploited every year in this form of trafficking.
            <br><br>
            As you read these bits of information out loud, Lynn is bawling her eyes out and stutters: Is there anything else?
            <br><br>
            You reply honestly: Yes, one more piece of information.
