            It has been six years since you first walked by the red light district and witnessed children being auctioned off for sexual favors to the highest bidder. With a new found drive to help trafficked victims and survivors, you joined an organization that fights against human trafficking. Your organization uses funds donated from around the world to outbid those who would use the children and adults for sexual favors and provide them a safe home, clothing, food, education, and training for bright career paths. This is done in the hopes that none of them will find themselves being trafficked again in the future.

            Four days ago, your team freed five girls from being auctioned off for sex; however, they are experiencing night terrors, reliving the horrid events of their past. They also have nothing to their names: fresh clothes, cellphones, or items of comfort to keep the nightmares away. As you are thinking about helping these girls, you casually walk past the storage room connected to the kitchen and realize that food is running low. This isn't an immediate concern as of yet, but if ignored, some of the staff might have to reduce their consumption or even skip a meal or two in order to keep the survivors in their best health.<br> <br> Which problem will you prioritize over the other: <a class="Choices" href="page3.html">Grocery Shopping</a>  or <a class="Choices" href="page4.1.html">Shopping for Comfort</a>? </font></span>
