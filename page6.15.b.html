            After fifteen minutes, Lynn wipes the last remaining tears and replies: There are so many people suffering out there with only a bleak future in front of them. 
            <br> <br>
            You: Yes, but this is why we're here. To free as many as possible and restore their future.
            <br><br>
            Lynn: Yeah, I wouldn't have been able to discover my passion nor see a bright path in front of me if it weren't for you guys. I believe this is enough to think about for today as I bake for Jennifer and Sofia.

            <br> <br> Which survivor will you counsel today: <a class="Choices" href= "page6.17.b.html">Gwen</a> or <a class="Choices" href="page6.19.b.html">Belle</a></font></span>
