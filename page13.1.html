            You drive to a local grocery store and begin piling your cart. It's nearly overflowing due to how much food is required. You have no problem finding everything you need. Once you returned to the safe house, you began organizing the groceries in the storage room. As you finish stocking up and walk towards the entrance of the kitchen, you are approached by Lynn once more.
        <br><br>
        Lynn: Hey, I see you're filling up our food. Thank you so much!! I was worried some of us would go hungry tonight.
        <br><br>
        You: It's no problem. I am just glad that I got this done before anyone had to suffer. Are you possibly seeking more knowledge today?
        <br><br>
        Lynn: Yes, I wanted to learn about the impact human trafficking has on global health.
