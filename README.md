# Senior-Thesis

I created this project for my Senior Thesis course for my major in Interactive Media Studies.
It serves as an interactive, chapter and choice based narrative that walks users through a simulation 
of some of the decisions one might make while working in an organization that fights against human trafficking 
as well as provides statistical data to the users.
At the end of each chapter, the users are given a quiz on the information from the current chapter and all previous chapters.
This project is useful for anyone who wants to start learning about human trafficking as I have provided urls for all of the 
source material used within the project.
I soley maintain and contribute to this project on gihub.
