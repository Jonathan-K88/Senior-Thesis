            Lynn had a look of bewilderment: Wow. All of this is a lot to take in. Then again, I have been scared of asking about this subject on the off chance the discussion might trigger my memories to resurface. 
            <br> <br>
            You: I completely understand your hesitancy towards all of this and I am proud of you for finding the courage to learn more about a subject that you experienced first-hand as well as your passion in the culinary arts. I had the great privilege of meeting you all those years ago and you have grown so much since then. You are truly an inspiration. 
            <br> <br>
            Lynn: Thank you so much for freeing me from that nightmare and for helping me understand more about trafficking. I am going to see if Jess and Trish want to help me bake some cookies. See you later.
            <br> <br>
            You: See you later, Lynn.
