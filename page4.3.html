            You: I will try my best. You see, the definition of human trafficking isn't the easiest to articulate and depending on whom you ask, their answers could vary. For one example, the UN created something called "The Polermo Protocol" and it provides a very complex definition.
            <br> <br>
            Lynn: Oh, that makes sense. In that case, can you give me a simplified version of their definition? 
            <br> <br>
            You: Sure thing. They define human trafficking as "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of individuals" through a variety of methods including, but not limited to exploitation. [1]
            <br> <br>
            Lynn: Hmm, I hesitate to ask, but what forms of exploitation are used?
